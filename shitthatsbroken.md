Step sound effect (I can't figure out how to add it without the player becoming sluggish and the sfx rapid firing)
Pickup sound effect (same as above)
Reset signs (touching them is supposed to reset the blocks back to their default position.. Instead, they remove them all together)
Sometimes pushing a block into a hole will trigger a block away from the hole
