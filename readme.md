		- Add a droppable bridge in that one level
		- Add bombs and maybe a new type of rock
		- Add the lens of truth
		- Add stairs
		- Allow the player to break those 2 wall blocks with the pickaxe

	later
		- Screen flash red on death
		- Add sound effects
		- Add a really dumb joke ending.. like "Congratulations, hero... But your princess is in another castle.. To be continued?"
		- Reset puzzles when leaving the room if not complete (also, when moving from floor to floor on different rooms, idk how but maybe see about making the puzzles persistent)
